#| Assignment 2 - Using Backtracking

This file contains starter code for questions 4-6,
which involve using backtracking in interesting ways, and
extending the functionality of the backtracking library.

(subsets lst)
  lst: a list

  A choice expression which yields a subset of 'lst'.
  Repeated calls to 'next' should yield *all* other subsets
  (i.e., 'next' returns "false." only when all subsets of 'lst'
  have been returned).

  The subsets can be yielded in any order; however, no subset
  can appear twice.

  Note that:
    - A subset isn't the same as a sublist. Items don't have to be consecutive.
    - A subset can be empty; the empty set is a subset of any list.
    - Order doesn't matter in subsets
  
  The following is an example of how 'subsets' is used.
  Note that your implementation might yield the subsets
  in a different order than the one shown here.

> (subsets '(1 2))
'()
> (next)
'(1)
> (next)
'(2)
> (next)
'(1 2)
> (next)
"false."

(define (add-to-all lst item)
  (if (equal? lst null)
      '()
      (cons (cons item (car lst))
            (add-to-all (cdr lst) item))))

(define (powerset lst)
  (if (equal? lst null)
      '(())
      (let ((all (powerset (cdr lst))))
            (append (add-to-all all (car lst)) all))))

(define (all-< lst)
  (cond [(empty? lst) lst]
        [(= (length lst) 1) (first lst)]
        [(-< (first lst) (all-< (rest lst)))]
        ))

(define (subsets lst)
  (all-< (powerset lst)))

(sudoku-4 puzzle)
  puzzle: a nested list representing a 4-by-4 Sudoku puzzle

  A choice expression that represents possible solutions to the puzzle.
  Upon evaluation, just one solution is returned, but repeated calls
  to 'next' produces more possible solutions, if any.

  Hint: use the ?- function in your solution. Again, your main task
  is just to correctly express the constraints, and let the computer
  do the work.

; QUESTION 5

(fold-< combine init expr)
  combine: a binary function
  init: an initial value
  expr: a choice expression

  Evaluate all choices in <expr> and combine them, one at a time, with the
  initial value, and return the result.

  Note that the order of <combine>'s parameters is the same as foldl:
    1) The value of the next choice
    2) The value of <init>
